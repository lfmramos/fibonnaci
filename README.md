# Recursive Fibonacci

This repository contains implementations of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion in both Java and Python.

## Java Implementation

The Java implementation is provided in the file [Recursive_Fibonacci.java](Recursive_Fibonacci.java). It includes a class `Recursive_Fibonacci` with a method to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively.

### Usage

To run the Java implementation, compile and execute the `Recursive_Fibonacci` class:

```sh
javac 
java Recursive_Fibonacci
```

This will print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Python Implementation
The Python implementation is provided in the file recursive_fibonacci.py. It includes a function fibonacci to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively.

### Usage
To run the Python implementation, execute the recursive_fibonacci.py file:

```sh
python recursive_fibonacci.py
```
